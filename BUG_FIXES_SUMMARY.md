# Event Koi - Bug Fixes Summary

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **External Registration Button Not Working**
**Problem**: When an event had external registration, clicking "Register Now" wasn't redirecting to the external URL.

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript was trying to set `href` property on a button element instead of handling the click event properly.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `js/event_page.js` to properly handle external registration buttons
- Added click event listeners for both main registration button and hero section button
- External links now show the warning modal before redirecting
- Updated button text to "Register on External Site" for clarity

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_page.js` (lines ~341-370)

### 2. **External Link Validation Blocking Form Progression**
**Problem**: During event creation, if a "harmful" or invalid external link was provided, users couldn't proceed to the next step.

**Root Cause**: The validation was too strict and blocking progression even for minor URL format issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified step 3 validation in `js/event_creation.js`
- Now allows progression if URL is in valid format (even with HTTPS warnings)
- Only blocks progression for completely invalid URL formats
- Maintains security by validating URL structure

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_creation.js` (lines ~114-126)

### 3. **Registration Deadline "Required" Error Despite Being Optional**
**Problem**: Form showed registration deadline as optional ("Leave blank if registration remains open until event starts") but backend was throwing "required" errors.

**Root Cause**: Event schema had `registrationDeadline` field set to `required: true`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `registrationDeadline` field to `required: false` in Event model
- Backend now properly accepts null/empty values for registration deadline
- Form behavior now matches the UI indication

**Files Modified**:
- `models/Event.js` (line ~33)

---

### 4. **No Redirect After Event Creation**
**Problem**: After successfully creating an event, users stayed on the form page instead of being redirected to their dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Success handler was resetting the form instead of redirecting.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified success handler in `js/event_creation.js`
- Now redirects to `organizer.html` after successful event creation
- Provides better user flow and immediate access to dashboard

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_creation.js` (lines ~523-528)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Instructions:**

### Test 1: External Registration
1. Create an event with external registration method
2. Provide an external URL (e.g., `https://forms.google.com/...`)
3. View the event page
4. Click "Register Now" - should show warning modal and redirect to external site

### Test 2: External Link Validation
1. Go to event creation form
2. Select external registration
3. Enter an invalid URL (e.g., `not-a-url`)
4. Try to proceed - should show error
5. Enter a valid HTTP URL - should allow progression with warning
6. Enter a valid HTTPS URL - should allow progression without warning

### Test 3: Optional Registration Deadline
1. Create an event and leave registration deadline blank
2. Form should submit successfully without errors
3. Check database - `registrationDeadline` should be null

### Test 4: Dashboard Redirect
1. Complete event creation process
2. After successful submission, should automatically redirect to `organizer.html`
3. No manual navigation required
