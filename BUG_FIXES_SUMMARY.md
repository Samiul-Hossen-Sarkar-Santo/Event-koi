# Event Koi - Bug Fixes Summary

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **External Registration Button Not Working**
**Problem**: When an event had external registration, clicking "Register Now" wasn't redirecting to the external URL.

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript was trying to set `href` property on a button element instead of handling the click event properly.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `js/event_page.js` to properly handle external registration buttons
- Added click event listeners for both main registration button and hero section button
- External links now show the warning modal before redirecting
- Updated button text to "Register on External Site" for clarity

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_page.js` (lines ~341-370)

---

### 2. **External Link Validation Blocking Form Progression**
**Problem**: During event creation, if a "harmful" or invalid external link was provided, users couldn't proceed to the next step.

**Root Cause**: The validation was too strict and blocking progression even for minor URL format issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified step 3 validation in `js/event_creation.js`
- Now allows progression if URL is in valid format (even with HTTPS warnings)
- Only blocks progression for completely invalid URL formats
- Maintains security by validating URL structure

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_creation.js` (lines ~114-126)

---

### 3. **Registration Deadline "Required" Error Despite Being Optional**
**Problem**: Form showed registration deadline as optional ("Leave blank if registration remains open until event starts") but backend was throwing "required" errors.

**Root Cause**: Event schema had `registrationDeadline` field set to `required: true`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `registrationDeadline` field to `required: false` in Event model
- Backend now properly accepts null/empty values for registration deadline
- Form behavior now matches the UI indication

**Files Modified**:
- `models/Event.js` (line ~33)

---

### 4. **No Redirect After Event Creation**
**Problem**: After successfully creating an event, users stayed on the form page instead of being redirected to their dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Success handler was resetting the form instead of redirecting.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified success handler in `js/event_creation.js`
- Now redirects to `organizer.html` after successful event creation
- Provides better user flow and immediate access to dashboard

**Files Modified**:
- `js/event_creation.js` (lines ~523-528)

---

### 5. **Event Report Submission Failing** âœ… **JUST FIXED**
**Problem**: The event reporting functionality was failing with database validation errors:
- `Report validation failed: reportedBy: Path 'reportedBy' is required`
- `AdminLog validation failed: adminId: Path 'adminId' is required, action: 'report_received' is not a valid enum value`

**Root Cause**: 
- Report model required authenticated user but route allowed anonymous reports
- AdminLog was being created inappropriately for user actions
- Missing enum values in AdminLog model

**Fix Applied**:
- âœ… Added `isAuthenticated` middleware to report route - requires login
- âœ… Simplified report creation to use authenticated user ID  
- âœ… Removed unnecessary AdminLog creation for user reports
- âœ… Added missing enum values to AdminLog model
- âœ… Enhanced frontend error handling with 401 authentication prompts

**Files Modified**:
- `routes/events.js` - Fixed report creation logic
- `models/AdminLog.js` - Added missing enum values
- `js/event_page.js` - Enhanced authentication error handling

**Current Status**: âœ… FULLY WORKING
- Users can successfully report events after logging in
- Clear authentication prompts when login required
- Reports properly saved to database for admin review

---

### 6. **Admin Reports Not Showing in Dashboard** âœ… **JUST FIXED**
**Problem**: The admin dashboard Reports Panel was showing "No reports found" even when reports existed in the database.

**Root Cause**: 
- Admin authentication was incomplete - login route wasn't setting `req.session.isAdmin = true`
- Admin-check route required both `userRole === 'admin'` AND `isAdmin === true`
- Without proper admin session, reports endpoint returned 403 Forbidden

**Fix Applied**:
- âœ… Updated login route to set `req.session.isAdmin = true` for admin users
- âœ… Added `req.session.adminLoginTime` for admin session tracking
- âœ… Created test reports in database for verification
- âœ… Verified admin authentication flow works correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `routes/auth.js` - Fixed admin session creation in login route
- `create-test-reports.js` - Script to create sample reports for testing

**Current Status**: âœ… FULLY WORKING
- Admin users can now log in and access all admin features
- Reports Panel properly displays submitted reports
- All admin dashboard functionality operational

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Instructions:**

### Test 1: External Registration
1. Create an event with external registration method
2. Provide an external URL (e.g., `https://forms.google.com/...`)
3. View the event page
4. Click "Register Now" - should show warning modal and redirect to external site

### Test 2: External Link Validation
1. Go to event creation form
2. Select external registration
3. Enter an invalid URL (e.g., `not-a-url`)
4. Try to proceed - should show error
5. Enter a valid HTTP URL - should allow progression with warning
6. Enter a valid HTTPS URL - should allow progression without warning

### Test 3: Optional Registration Deadline
1. Create an event and leave registration deadline blank
2. Form should submit successfully without errors
3. Check database - `registrationDeadline` should be null

### Test 4: Dashboard Redirect
1. Complete event creation process
2. After successful submission, should automatically redirect to `organizer.html`
3. No manual navigation required

### Test 5: Event Reporting
1. Log in as a user
2. Navigate to an event page
3. Click on "Report Event"
4. Submit a report - should succeed without validation errors
5. Check admin panel - report should be visible with correct details

### Test 6: Admin Reports Dashboard
